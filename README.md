RAPIC – Random Ad Position in Content for Mecha
===============================================

This plugin will automatically insert your ad code into the page content with random position between the existing paragraphs.

### Usage

Open `lot\extend\plugin\lot\worker\r-a-p-i-c\lot\worker\content.php` then put your ad code there.

To disable the automatic ad placement on certain page, add a `rapic` header property with a value that can be evaluated to `false`:

~~~ .yaml
---
title: Page Title
description: Page description.
