This plugin will automatically insert your advertisements code into the page content with random position between the existing paragraphs.

### Usage

Open `.\lot\extend\plugin\lot\worker\r-a-p-i-c\lot\worker\content.php` then put your advertisements code there.

To disable the automatic advertisements placement on certain page, add a `r-a-p-i-c` property within your page’s `state` property with a value that can be evaluated to `false`:

~~~ .yaml
